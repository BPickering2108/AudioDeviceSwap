# AudioDeviceSwap

Script for toggling active audio devices, with a notification to tell you which is active


First, run the ModuleInstalls script to install the required modules and get a list of your audio devices - make a note of the device IDs you want to toggle between

Then, edit the AudioDeviceSwap script to include the names of the devices, the IDs, the notification text and image location

Finally, edit the PackageFileAsEXE script to include the file location and name of the AudioDeviceSwap file, and the file location and name for your exe

The exe file can then easily be used with macro software
